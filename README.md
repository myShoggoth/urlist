Demo site for my d3.js generated yesod/shakespeare changes.

## Shakespeare

This demo site shows a simple example using my changes to Shakespeare at https://github.com/myShoggoth/shakespeare which
takes additional attributes and tags in a hamlet template and automatically generates http://d3.js/ code to handle
enter/exit/update as well as Server-based Events for live updating.

This code is pretty early, I don't love the syntax and it is hardly bullet proof, but it is good enough to be useful in
production sites as long as your needs are the same as mine.

Anyone interested in contributing is welcome, let me know.
